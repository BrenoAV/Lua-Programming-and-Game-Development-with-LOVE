# Lua-Programming-and-Game-Development-with-LOVE

Repository to store my personal implementation of the course: [Lua Programming and Game Development with LÃ–VE - Kyle Schaub](https://www.udemy.com/course/lua-love/)

# Games

1. [Shooting Game](ShootingGame/) **Complete**
2. [Top Down Shooter](TopDownShooter/) **Complete**
3. [Plataformer](Platformer/) **Complete**

# Notes

- For the 3rd game I don't use the [windfield](https://github.com/a327ex/windfield) library like the Kyle used it, because the repository is archived in the moment and I don't know whether the owner will update it in the future. I use only traditional way for collisions (love2d).
